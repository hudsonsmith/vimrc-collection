# vimrc-collection
A collection of .vimrc files for all levels of experience.

## Beginner.vim
In the beginner.vim file you will have access to arrow keys and access to the mouse.

**This is for learning vim only!**

**When using Vim please use the H J K L keys and do not use the mouse.**

## Hardcore.vim
In the hardcore.vim file you will not have access to the mouse, Arrow keys, Page-Up/Down keys, and Home/End keys.

This is how Vim should be used.

If you are a beginner I suggest working up to hardcore.vim.
